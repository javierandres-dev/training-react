## Learn
### Describing the UI
* Your First Component
  - What a component is
  - What role components play in a React application
  - How to write your first React component

* Importing and Exporting Components
  - What a root component file is
  - How to import and export a component
  - When to use default and named imports and exports
  - How to export multiple components from the same file
  - How to import and export multiple components from one file
  - How to split components into multiple files

* Writing Markup with JSX
  - Why React mixes markup with rendering logic
  - How JSX is different from HTML
  - How to display information with JSX
  * The Rules of JSX
    1. Return a single root element
    2. Close all the tags
    3. camelCase all most of the things!

* JavaScript in JSX with Curly Braces
  - How to pass strings with quotes
  - How to reference a JavaScript variable inside JSX with curly braces
  - How to call a JavaScript function inside JSX with curly braces
  - How to use a JavaScript object inside JSX with curly braces

* Passing Props to a Component
  - How to pass props to a component
  - How to read props from a component
  - How to specify default values for props
  - How to pass some JSX to a component
  - Passing JSX as children
  - How props change over time
  - You can’t change props. When you need interactivity, you’ll need to set state

* Conditional Rendering
  - How to return different JSX depending on a condition
  - How to conditionally include or exclude a piece of JSX
  - Common conditional syntax shortcuts you’ll encounter in React codebases

* Rendering Lists
  - How to render components from an array using JavaScript’s map()
  - How to render only specific components using JavaScript’s filter()
  - When and why to use React keys

* Keeping Components Pure
  - What purity is and how it helps you avoid bugs
  - How to keep components pure by keeping changes out of the render phase
  - How to use Strict Mode to find mistakes in your components
  - React assumes that every component you write is a pure function
  * In React there are three kinds of inputs that you can read while rendering:
    - props, state, and context. You should always treat these inputs as read-only.

* Understanding Your UI as a Tree
  - How React “sees” component structures
  - What a render tree is and what it is useful for
  - What a module dependency tree is and what it is useful for
